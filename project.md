## 1. Vision

Akan-BPE is an Akan-focused research project investigating the "Tokenization Tax":
the tendency for African languages to require far more tokens than English under
standard LLM tokenizers, increasing latency, cost, and fragmentation.

The current project is intentionally narrow.

Akan-BPE is not yet a model-training or deployment project. The current phase only asks:

- can specialized Akan tokenizers outperform a baseline tokenizer?
- does ASR-style Akan benefit from a different vocabulary than formal Akan?
- is one mixed tokenizer enough, or do two specialized tokenizers appear justified?

---

## 2. Current Scope

The active scope is tokenizer + routing experiments.

**Completed:**
- Akan data collection and normalization (80/10/10 local split for ASR)
- BPE tokenizer training (ASR, TTS, Mixed)
- Tokenizer comparison against multilingual baselines (XLM-R, mBERT, mT5)
- Token fertility benchmarking (~52% ASR reduction, ~47% TTS reduction vs best baseline)
- Balanced mixed tokenizer (corpus upsampling — now genuinely differentiates domains)
- Heuristic router implementation
- ML classifier router (99.99% train/test accuracy on stratified held-out split)

**Next phases:**
- Model integration (embedding resize, fine-tune, eval)
- Edge deployment (GGUF export, Dell Latitude 7400 benchmarking)

---

## 3. Core Idea

Akan appears to contain at least two useful text regimes:

1. **ASR / spontaneous Akan**
   This is noisy, conversational, and often includes fillers, short forms, and code-switching.

2. **Formal / TTS-like Akan**
   This is cleaner, more structured, and more semantically dense.

The main hypothesis is simple:

- a tokenizer trained on ASR-style Akan may tokenize ASR-like input more efficiently
- a tokenizer trained on formal Akan may tokenize formal input more efficiently

Before building routers or model paths, Akan-BPE first needs to verify that this specialization is real.

---

## 4. Research Question

The current phase asks:

**Do specialized Akan tokenizers show measurable advantages over a standard baseline tokenizer, and over each other, on different Akan text regimes?**

More concretely:

- does an ASR-trained tokenizer reduce fertility on ASR test text?
- does a TTS-trained tokenizer reduce fertility on formal test text?
- does a mixed tokenizer perform well enough that two specialized tokenizers are unnecessary?

---

## 5. Data Sources

Akan-BPE uses two Akan datasets:

### 5.1 WAXAL `aka_asr`

- Source: `google/WaxalNLP`
- Type: spontaneous Akan ASR transcriptions
- Characteristics:
  - conversational
  - noisy
  - filler-heavy
  - code-switching tolerant

### 5.2 Pristine-Twi

- Source: Ghana NLP `pristine-twi`
- Type: clean formal Akan text
- Characteristics:
  - structured
  - grammatically cleaner
  - more formal and semantically dense

These two corpora define the dual-stream tokenizer experiment.

---

## 6. Phase 1 Experimental Design

This phase compares tokenizers only.

### 6.1 Tokenizer Variants

The recommended tokenizer variants are:

| Variant | Description | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| **Control** | Existing baseline tokenizer from a pretrained model | Reference point |
| **Variant A** | Tokenizer trained only on ASR text | Specialized conversational tokenizer |
| **Variant B** | Tokenizer trained only on formal/TTS text | Specialized formal tokenizer |
| **Variant C** | Tokenizer trained on mixed ASR + TTS text | Single-tokenizer compromise |

For now, these are tokenizer variants, not model variants.

### 6.2 Deferred Variants

The original project also considered staged variants such as:

- `TTS -> ASR -> TTS`
- `ASR -> TTS`

Those ideas are not the first priority in tokenizer-only phase 1.
They may be revisited later if the basic A/B/C results show clear separation.

---

## 7. Experimental Goal

The immediate goal is to produce one clean comparison table across two test sets.

Target benchmark table:

| Tokenizer | ASR Test Fertility | TTS Test Fertility | Interpretation |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Control | baseline | baseline | Standard reference |
| Variant A | ? | ? | Expected strength on ASR-style Akan |
| Variant B | ? | ? | Expected strength on formal Akan |
| Variant C | ? | ? | Mixed compromise candidate |

This table is the primary deliverable for phase 1.

---

## 8. Metric

### Primary metric: Token Fertility

Token fertility is defined as:

`F = total_tokens / total_words`

This is the main evaluation metric for the current phase.

Interpretation:

- lower is better, if text quality and meaning preservation are not being altered
- a tokenizer is more efficient when it needs fewer tokens per word on the same text

### Phase 1 success criteria

Success in phase 1 does not require a complete product.
It requires a clear empirical result, such as:

- Variant A performs best on ASR test text
- Variant B performs best on TTS test text
- Variant C performs competitively on both
- or one tokenizer dominates both regimes and weakens the dual-tokenizer hypothesis

Any of those are valid findings.

---

## 9. Recommended Workflow

The current recommended workflow is:

### Step 1: Download and normalize Akan data

Use `download.py` to create standardized JSONL files under `data/`.

Recommended filenames:

- `aka_asr_train.jsonl`
- `aka_asr_validation.jsonl`
- `aka_asr_test.jsonl`
- `pristine_twi_train.jsonl`
- `pristine_twi_validation.jsonl`
- `pristine_twi_test.jsonl`

### Step 2: Train tokenizer variants

Train:

- ASR tokenizer from `aka_asr_train.jsonl`
- TTS tokenizer from `pristine_twi_train.jsonl`
- mixed tokenizer from both training sets

All tokenizer variants should use:

- the same algorithm
- the same vocab size
- the same special tokens

This keeps the comparison fair.

### Step 3: Benchmark fertility

Run one unified benchmark experiment that evaluates all selected tokenizers on:

- ASR test text
- TTS test text

This should produce one comparison JSON, not many small result files.

### Step 4: Interpret the results

Possible outcomes:

- specialization is real
- one mixed tokenizer is enough
- one tokenizer dominates everything

Only after that should the project consider routing or model work.

## 10. Repository Structure

The current project should be understood through this simplified structure:

```text
akan_bpe/
├── data/                        # normalized Akan datasets
├── models/                      # trained tokenizer artifacts
├── results/                     # benchmark outputs
├── scripts/

│   ├── train_bpe.py             # tokenizer training
│   └── benchmark_fertility.py
├── akan_bpe/                       # thin helpers for tokenizer-only experiments

└── project.md
```

---

## 11. Canonical File Contracts

### 11.1 Data files

Recommended JSONL schema:

```json
{"id": "sample_id", "text": "some twi text", "source": "aka_asr"}
```

If existing scripts use `transcription`, that is acceptable, but the repo should converge on one field contract over time.

### 11.2 Tokenizer artifacts

Recommended outputs:

- `models/asr_tokenizer.json`
- `models/tts_tokenizer.json`
- `models/mixed_tokenizer.json`

Optional metadata:

- training stats
- corpus sizes
- vocab summaries

### 11.3 Benchmark outputs

Akan-BPE should use one simple rule:

- one experiment run produces one JSON file

Recommended result file:

- `results/tokenizer_fertility_experiment_001.json`

That file should contain:

- experiment metadata
- the tokenizers included in the run
- the test sets used
- fertility results for every tokenizer on every test set
- a short summary of which tokenizer performed best where

The project should avoid scattering one experiment across many small output files.

---

## 12. Best Practices For Phase 1

To keep the project small and defensible:

- vary one major factor at a time
- keep vocab size constant across tokenizer variants
- keep special tokens constant across tokenizer variants
- use the same test files for every benchmark
- save every benchmark result to JSON
- treat one benchmark run as one complete experiment with one output JSON
- avoid mixing tokenizer experiments with model experiments
- document the exact corpus used for each tokenizer

This phase should produce a clear result before the repo takes on more complexity.

---

## 13. What This Phase Is Not Trying To Prove

Phase 1 is not trying to prove:

- better Akan reasoning by a model
- better generation quality
- better LoRA adaptation
- better edge deployment performance

Those are important, but they belong to later phases.

The only thing phase 1 must prove is whether specialized tokenizers for Akan are worth pursuing.

---

## 14. Future Directions

If phase 1 shows strong specialization effects, Akan-BPE can expand in carefully staged steps.

### 14.1 Router / mux experiment (COMPLETED)

- Implemented heuristic-based router (77.6% accuracy)
- Trained ML classifier (TF-IDF + Logistic Regression, 99.99% train/test accuracy on stratified 80/20 split)
- Per-class F1: ASR 0.9998, TTS 0.9999
- Benchmark showed ML router achieves optimal fertility (matches always-best-tokenizer strategy)

**Status:** Complete - ML router significantly outperforms heuristic; accuracy confirmed on held-out test set

### 14.2 Incremental tokenizer variants

If basic A/B/C results are promising, the project can revisit staged corpus ideas such as:

- `TTS -> ASR -> TTS`
- `ASR -> TTS`

These should only be attempted after the simpler comparisons are complete.

### 14.3 Model integration

If specialized tokenizers clearly help, a later phase may explore:

- resizing model vocabularies
- initializing embeddings for new tokenizer vocabularies
- comparing specialized model paths

This is a separate project phase and should not be merged into the current tokenizer-only work.

### 14.4 Edge deployment

If tokenizer and routing experiments succeed, future work may include:

- exporting model artifacts for local inference
- benchmarking on the Dell Latitude 7400
- measuring latency, tokens per second, and memory use

### 14.5 Akan task evaluation

A later evaluation phase may test whether tokenizer gains translate to useful model behavior on tasks such as:

- Akan QA
- instruction following
- curated prompt-response evaluation

This should only happen after the tokenizer question is clearly answered.

---

## 15. Phase 1 Deliverables (COMPLETE)

1. ✅ normalized Akan ASR and TTS datasets (80/10/10 local split)
2. ✅ three trained tokenizer variants: ASR, TTS, Mixed (corpus-balanced)
3. ✅ fertility benchmark vs multilingual baselines (XLM-R, mBERT, mT5) — not GPT-2
4. ✅ unified experiment JSON with fertility comparison
5. ✅ technical report (report.md) documenting findings
6. ✅ ML classifier router (99.99% train/test accuracy, stratified held-out eval)
7. ✅ End-to-end notebook (train_eval.ipynb)

**Conclusion:** Specialization is real — ASR tokenizer achieves ~52% fertility reduction, TTS ~47%, both vs best multilingual baseline (mBERT). Balanced mixed tokenizer interpolates between domains (1.20 ASR, 1.27 TTS) and is viable where routing infrastructure is unavailable.

---

## 16. Phase 2: Next Steps

Phase 1 answered the tokenizer question. Phase 2 asks whether those gains translate to a real model.

### 16.1 Model Integration

**Goal:** Verify that fertility reduction translates into measurable downstream benefit — faster inference, lower perplexity, or better generation — not just a smaller token count.

**Recommended base model:** Start small. `Qwen2.5-0.5B` or `LLaMA-3.2-1B` are manageable on Colab Free / CPU for initial experiments. Scale up only if results are promising.

**Steps:**

1. **Choose tokenizer to integrate** — start with the TTS tokenizer (most training data, best-in-class fertility on formal text). The router can be layered in later.

2. **Resize token embeddings**
   ```python
   from transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM, AutoTokenizer
   from tokenizers import Tokenizer

   base_model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained("Qwen/Qwen2.5-0.5B")
   new_tokenizer = PreTrainedTokenizerFast(tokenizer_file="models/tts_tokenizer.json")
   base_model.resize_token_embeddings(len(new_tokenizer))
   ```
   New token embeddings initialize randomly; existing tokens that map to the new vocab keep their weights where possible.

3. **Re-tokenize training data** — run `pristine_twi_train.jsonl` through the new tokenizer to produce training inputs for fine-tuning.

4. **Fine-tune** — LoRA is the practical choice on limited hardware. Full fine-tune only if GPU VRAM allows.
   - Library: `peft` + `transformers` Trainer or `trl` SFTTrainer
   - Target modules: attention Q/K/V projections
   - Rank: r=8 or r=16 to start

5. **Evaluate**
   - **Perplexity** on `pristine_twi_test.jsonl` — compare base model (original tokenizer) vs fine-tuned (new tokenizer)
   - **Generation quality** — BLEU or chrF on a small Akan reference set if available; otherwise qualitative review
   - **Inference speed** — tokens/second before and after to quantify the fertility gain in practice

**Success criterion:** Fine-tuned model with new tokenizer matches or exceeds base model perplexity on Akan test text, with fewer tokens processed per sample.

**Failure mode to watch for:** If perplexity is significantly worse after embedding resize, the initialization strategy needs work (e.g., averaging subword embeddings from the original vocab that cover similar character sequences).

---

### 16.2 Edge Deployment

**Goal:** Benchmark tokenizer + router + model on the Dell Latitude 7400 to understand real-world latency and memory footprint.

**Prerequisite:** Model integration (16.1) must produce a usable model artifact first.

**Steps:**

1. **Export to GGUF**
   ```bash
   python llama.cpp/convert_hf_to_gguf.py models/akan_tts_model/ --outtype q4_k_m
   ```
   Q4_K_M quantization is a good starting point — balances quality and size for a 0.5–1B model.

2. **Bundle the router** — the router classifier (`models/router_classifier.pkl`) adds ~1ms per call; confirm this overhead is negligible on the target hardware.

3. **Benchmark on Dell Latitude 7400**

   Metrics to collect:
   | Metric | Tool |
   |--------|------|
   | Tokens/second | `llama-bench` or manual timing |
   | Peak RAM | `psutil` or Task Manager |
   | Time-to-first-token | manual timing in Python |
   | Router overhead | `time.perf_counter()` around `classifier.predict()` |

4. **Compare configurations**
   - Base model, original tokenizer (GPT-2 vocab)
   - Fine-tuned model, Akan TTS tokenizer
   - Fine-tuned model + ML router (dynamic tokenizer selection)

**Success criterion:** Fine-tuned Akan model generates tokens faster (more tokens/second or fewer tokens per prompt) than the base model on Akan input, with acceptable RAM footprint for the target hardware.
